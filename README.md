# Java and Python Interoperability

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how Java can interact with Python using py4j. We will create a simple Java application that calls a Python function to perform a calculation.

## Setup Instructions

1. Add the necessary files to the repository.
2. Configure GitHub Actions for continuous integration.
3. Run the Java application to see the interoperability in action.

## Usage

Run the Java application to invoke a Python function and see the result.

## CI Setup

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The CI pipeline is defined in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.
